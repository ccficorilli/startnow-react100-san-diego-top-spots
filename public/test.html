        <h4>Go For A Run In The San Diego Zoo Safari Park</h4>
        <p>A half marathon on a trail running through the Safari Park, where animals roam free? Sounds like a barrel of monkeys
            (or rhinos).</p>

            cosplay, contests, it’s all here and so much more. Even if you can’t get a ticket, it’s worth stopping by the
